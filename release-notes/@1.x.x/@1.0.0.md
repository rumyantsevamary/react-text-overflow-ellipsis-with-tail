# react-text-overflow-ellipsis-with-tail@1.0.0

# Changes:
Initial version of component with features:
- React component for shortening single-line text. The maximum width of the text is limited by the width of the container. 
The text that does not fit is reduced to an ellipsis (...), but the last N characters should always be output.
- By coping visible parts of the string you would copy the entire string including hidden parts.
